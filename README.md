# Walmart Sales Analysis 📊
 
This project analyzes Walmart sales data using SQL Server, Python, and Power BI. It covers data cleaning, loading, and visualizing insights like total sales, category performance, and branch comparisons.

This is something I’m very familiar with, as I do it regularly in my work — handling data end-to-end, from extraction and transformation to building interactive reports.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **sql/**: SQL scripts for data storage
- **python/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing and database insertion.
- **powerbi/**: Power BI report for interactive data visualization.
- **images/**: Screenshots of the final dashboard.

- ## 🛠️ Tools Used
